do number of hops to default DNS, see if it is one. If so, then if there is two hops, there must be a middlebox.
Could set TTL = 1, or TTL = 2 to do so?

IP blocking can be determined if IP address is accessible from another ISP, but not another.

403 errors can be due to cloudflare blocking direct IP access
If public DNS servers IP address varies from ISP to ISP, then, DNS injection is happening, especially if the response code varies

if 451 error, this means that the IP is blocked, and another isp provides a different IP, then you know the 451 is dns blocked

dns injection of public DNS's can be detected if the public DNS IP's are different (e.g. googles dns resolves different ips from different isps)

can't use 403:forbidden errors because sometimes they cloudflare, maybe web-scrape these to determine if cloudflare?

can't determine if it is domain name blocking, because sometimes IP's have been spoofed such that they go to a webpage with "content denied" and return a 200 response code.

might need to send entire html or selenium screenshot of page so we can find different phrases of blockpages

#next steps
read the last two columns in to the ISP_Domain_Results_Interpreter

check that by changing the ";" to a ',' in the results file e.g. AARC_12Apr, that there is no issue caused by the interpreter

i think there might be a bug where it is checking the same ip multiple times for the default dns server - something to investigate

#efficiency improvements
once an IP address has been checked, make it so it doesn't need to be analysed again. Lots of duplicate IP's when DNS tampering is involved.
